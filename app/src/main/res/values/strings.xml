        Just start the Shield and you will never be attacked!\n\n
           \t &#8226; You can normally play CoC while Infinity Shield is active.\n
           \t &#8226; You don\’t need to change any settings.\n
           \t &#8226; You don\'t need rooted device.\n
           \t &#8226; You don\’t eed o worry about getting raided :)\n\n
        How it works?\n
        Shield starts CoC periodically, which keeps it logged in. It does not modify the state of the game.\n
        Simple? Yes! That\'s why it works!
